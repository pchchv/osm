osm/osmgeojson [![Godoc Reference](https://godoc.org/github.com/pchchv/osm/osmgeojson?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/pchchv/osm/osmgeojson)

Package `osmgeojson` converts OSM data to GeoJSON. 
- real OSM polygon detection
- OSM multipolygon support, e.g. buildings with holes become proper multipolygons
- supports annotated geometries
- well tested

### Usage

```go
delta := 0.0001
lon, lat := -83.5997038, 41.5923682
bounds := &osm.Bounds{
	MinLat: lat - delta, MaxLat: lat + delta,
	MinLon: lon - delta, MaxLon: lon + delta,
}

// fetch data from the osm api
o, _ := osmapi.Map(ctx, bounds) 
// run the conversion
fc, err := osmgeojson.Convert(o, opts)
// marshal the json
gj, _ := json.MarshalIndent(fc, "", " ")
fmt.Println(string(gj))
```

### Options

Package provides several options to control what is included in the feature properties. If possible, excluding some of the extra properties	can greatly improve the performance. All of the options **default to false**, i.e. everything will be included.

* `NoID(yes bool)`

	Controls whether to set the feature.ID to "type/id" e.g. "node/475373687". For some use cases this may be of limited use since the feature.Properies "type" and "id" are also set.

* `NoMeta(yes bool)`

	Controls whether to populate the "meta" property which is a sub-map with the following values from the osm element: "timestamp", "version", "changeset", "user", "uid".

* `NoRelationMembership(yes bool)`

	Controls whether to include a list of the relations the osm element is a member of. This info is set as the "relation" property which is an array of objects with the following values from the relation: "id", "role", "tags".

* `IncludeInvalidPolygons(yes bool)`

	By default, inner rings of 'multipolygon' without a matching outer ring will be ignored. However, in some use cases the outer ring can be implied as the viewport bound and the inner rings can then be rendered correctly. Polygons with a nil first ring will be need to be updated such
	that the first ring is the viewport bound. This options will also include rings that do not have matching endpoints. Usually this means one or more of the outer ways are missing.
